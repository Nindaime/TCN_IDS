# TCN_IDS
Implements the Keras-TCN by '[philipperemy](https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn.git)' for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on '[CIC-Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/cicidscollection)' Dataset. The results in the notebook show the TCN outperforms the LSTM, BiLSTM, and CNN networks with similar configurations.
